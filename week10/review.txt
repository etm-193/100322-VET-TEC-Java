Topics to Study
---------------
- What is Angular?
       -- JavaScript framework that makes our life easier
       -- it's specifically for building single-page applications
       -- it uses the idea of components to break an application down into reusable parts
- What is npm?
- What is a component?
       -- a piece of the application
       -- it wraps up the HTML/CSS/JS of that piece that is put into the application
       -- reusable pieces 
- routing
- forms
- template-driven forms
- reactive forms
- ngModel
- form validation
- data binding
- event binding
- ng commands we've used
    -- ng new project-name // new project
    -- ng g component component-name // creates component (ng g c also works)
    -- ng g class class-name // creates models
    -- ng serve --open // spins up a server (--o also works)

- decorators (@Component, @Input, etc)
- passing data parent to child
- passing data child to parent
- EventEmitter
- Component lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngOnChange, etc)
     -- important ones to know are ngOnInit, ngAfterViewInit, ngOnDestroy
     -- for doing stuff when it is created, displayed, or destroyed

- TypeScript (data types, functions, classes, arrays, objects)
