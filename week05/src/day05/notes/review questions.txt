Hash Code / Hash Set / Hash Map / Hash Table

Q1: Why is the under-the-hood hash table resized when it is 75% full?
- too many collisions, slows down look-up times, so resizes

Q: Hash Maps allow duplicate keys?
no - what do they allow duplicates of? values - yes 

Q: Can you store null in a Hash Set?
- yes
- multiplle null? no - it doesn't allow duplicates

Q: Load the factor of a hash table by definition?
load factor = occupied "buckets" / capacity

Q: What is a hash code?
int 

Recursion / Memoization

Q: What error if no base case in a recursive method?
StackOverflowError

Q: Why do we use memoization?
- trade space efficiency for time efficiency
- avoid recalculating values 
- save time

Q: Why do we use recursion?
- sometimes too complex to do iteratively
- same reason we use loops

Q: What are two ways to keep track of how far you are in a list when recursively searching it?
- use a index (like a while loop with a counter)
- use the size of the list
